Standards for the Alteryx Analytics Products team

## Contributing Standard(s)
### Adding standards
Small commits should be made; address one standard per commit. Small pull requests (one standard) are highly recommended when ammending standards. This will allow for standards to be accepted, rejected, or edited on a standard-by-standard basis.

### Review Process
After making a PR, tag each reviewer (e.g. `review needed from @piguy314159265, ...`) so that they will recieve a notification. Comments can be made, and thumbs-up and thumbs-down should be used for voting. This is a lighter mechanism than requesting code reviews and, although we'd prefer consensus, sometimes that's not possible; we can proceed with a majority.

Despite a majority being adequate, please wait to accept the PR until everyone has voted (even after obtaining a majority). This ensures everyone has had a chance to provide their opinion regarding a standard.
